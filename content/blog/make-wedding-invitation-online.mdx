Creating a wedding invitation has never been easier ðŸ˜«! Today, I am excited to share my latest project: a **free and customizable online wedding invitation template** built with modern web technologies.

## Q1: Why Build a Wedding Invitation?

Planning a wedding is a memorable journey, but it often comes with a long to-do list. Designing and distributing invitations can be costly and time-consuming. To help couples focus on what truly matters, I created a tool that makes it simple to build and share beautiful wedding invitations online.

## Q2: What is the Features

Here are some highlights of the project:

- **Built with Next.js and TypeScript**: Leveraging the power of modern frameworks for fast, reliable performance.
- **TailwindCSS**: Ensures the design is elegant and responsive.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Personalize every detail, including names, dates, events, and photos, via environment variables.
- **Interactive Elements**: Features like countdown timers, embedded YouTube videos, and personalized guest greetings make your invitation engaging.
- **Completely Free**: Fork the repository, customize it, and deploy it on your preferred platform.

## Q3: How It Works

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   First, grab the code from my GitHub repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/petershaan12/wedding-invitation.git
cd wedding-invitation
```
2. **Customize the Details**  
   Update the `.env.local` file with your wedding details, including:
   - Couple names
   - Wedding date
   - Event locations and Google Maps links
   - Music and photos

3. **Deploy the Invitation**  
   Once personalized, deploy your project using platforms like Vercel or Netlify for free hosting.
