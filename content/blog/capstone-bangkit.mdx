The story begins when I joined the [Bangkit Academy program led by Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, and Traveloka](https://grow.google/intl/id_id/bangkit/) which ran from early February 2024 to June 2024. Initially, I was hesitant about taking the mobile developer class because it focused on Android, which I thought was complicated and challenging ðŸ“±.

But to my surprise, Bangkit changed my perspective, and I started to enjoy Android development. I even took a solo approach for my capstone project. Capstone is the final project in Bangkit, where you need to create a startup product with a team as a graduation requirement. Yep, a team. But I ended up doing it alone.

The unexpected part is that I managed to complete my app four days ahead of schedule, which is today. My capstone project is an app called Fungi.info.

### Background

Initially, I didn't have a team for the capstone project ðŸ¥². Eventually, I teamed up with my campus friends Ocha and Gladwin, and a team from Brawijaya University. We decided to create an app for detecting mushrooms, which would be useful for travelers and explorers, or us as students when we're in the wild.

### Main Features

The main feature of this app is image classification using TensorFlow Lite, developed by our amazing ML team. It can detect different types of mushrooms, and the accuracy and articles displayed make the app quite engaging.

### Database

The app uses Firebase for its database because our cloud computing team was MIA until the last week. There was a lot of drama, but as a mobile developer, I had to step in and back things up. We also used Room Database to store entries for explorers who want to save mushroom data.

### Other Features

There are other features like changing profile pictures, cropping images, changing passwords, resetting passwords via email, and changing usernames. These may not be essential, but they add to the app's appeal.

### Release

Finally, as of today, the app is ready to be tested just like any other app out there. If you want to try it out, you can go to our [GitHub](https://github.com/Fungi-info-Bangkit-Capstone/android/releases/tag/Fungi.infov1.0) and download try the app.

That's the story of my solo capstone project. Bangkit has been a memorable experience for me, bringing new friends and challenging me to reach this far. Once again, thank you, Bangkit!
