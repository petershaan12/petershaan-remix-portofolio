Talking about browser, people immediately think of Google Chrome is'nt you? Yups It's the world's biggest player in internet surfing, with research it showing Chrome had a 72% market share in July 2023.

That's been true for me too. Ever since I started browsing the internet, I've tried lots of browsers like Safari, Mozilla, Opera, and Edge, but none of them could replace Chrome. Whether it's accessibility, a wide web view, tons of extensions, or developing programs, Chrome really rules the game.

But it's not about Chrome's greatness today's topic. The real topic is a browser that's been covering Chrome's flaws for me. After switching to Arc for the past 3 months, I've left Chrome behind completely. Chrome has gotten so big that it feels unbeatable, even by Microsoft. But I think that attitude could bring it down, just like Nokia back in the day.

The issue isn't about RAM, even though Chrome is a RAM hog. What I really want to highlight is Chrome's tab management. The way it handles tabs makes it tough to get stuff done. I admit itâ€”once I have a bunch of tabs open and they shrink to just little dots, it makes everything harder.

Even though Chrome has features like tab grouping and the ability to open two windows at once, it still doesnâ€™t solve the problem for me.


## That's where Arc comes in

> a new browser that, for me, really answers issue about tons of tab

[Arc](https://arc.net/) is amazing, in my opinion. Split-screen? âœ… check. Bookmarks? âœ… check. Tons of tabs? âœ…check. It's all wrapped up in Workspaces, which are my favorite feature and the solution I was looking for in Chrome. You can switch between different Workspaces while keeping one running. Plus, the customizable emojis and color Workspaces are super cool and aestheticâ€”I'm totally in love with Arc.

Another awesome thing about Arc is that the new tab opens as a popup. You can just preview it and then close it if you wantâ€”super convenient!

For me, Arc is the future of browsingâ€”amazing and beautiful. This is an honest review, not a promo from Arc. No matter how many Workspaces you have, when you close and reopen Arc, it keeps your tab history without needing to use Ctrl+Shift+Tab like in Chrome ðŸ˜†

But no great tool is without its flaws. On Windows, Arc still has some stability issues, and the sidebar can be a bit annoying, though you can just close it if needed. Still, these issues donâ€™t really interfere with my productivity, even with thousands of tabs open.

Here are some shortcuts I use daily in Arc:

<table style={{ margin: '0 auto', textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>shortcuts</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>ctrl+T</td>
      <td>Open a new tab</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ctrl+S</td>
      <td>Close the sidebar if you don't like it</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ctrl+L</td>
      <td>Change URL</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ctrl+D</td>
      <td>Bookmark</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ctrl+W</td>
      <td>Close the current tab or window</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ctrl+shift+C</td>
      <td>Copy URL</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Alt+1, Alt+2, Alt+3, etc.</td>
      <td>Switch between Workspaces</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ctrl+Tab</td>
      <td>Switch between tabs</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
